# Predicting graduate admissions
In this project I tried to predict graduate admissions based on a dataset published on [Kaggle, here.](https://www.kaggle.com/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions?select=Admission_Predict_Ver1.1.csv)

Specifically, My main goal of this project was to stack various _regression models_ on top of each other, to obtain the best results, My measure was to obtain lowest RMSLE score.

Code is in a IPython Notebook, and it is self explanatory.
